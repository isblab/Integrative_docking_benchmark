Here is an example of a heterodimeric complex with PDB 1CLV and 2 crosslinks were simulated. 

`easal` contains text output from EASAL run in `logfile.txt` and translations and rotations in `1clv_cl2_ss5.000000.txt` and corresponding PDB files in `1clv_cl2` directory.

`imp` contains input for IMP run in `/DSSO/1clv_2` and output from IMP analysis in `/DSSO_analysis/1clv_2/`.

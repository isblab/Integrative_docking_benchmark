Here is an example of a heterodimeric complex with PDB 1CLV and 2 simulated crosslinks. 

`easal` contains input files in `input` directory and output file in `output` directory. Text output from EASAL run is in `logfile.txt` and translations and rotations in `1clv_cl2_ss5.000000.txt` and corresponding PDB files in `1clv_cl2` directory.

`imp` contains input for IMP run in `input/1clv_2` and output from IMP analysis in `output/1clv_2/`.
